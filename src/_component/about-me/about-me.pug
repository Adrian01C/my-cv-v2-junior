    p Photography opens your mind and your eyes. You start noticing things in very high detail. Normal people wont notice a lot of things while walking on a street but youâ€™ll start noticing a broken window, a out of colour rooftop, a structure that should not have been there. You travel, learn, make mistakes and then try to improve. Photography is not just a hobby, it is an art of studying people and places.
